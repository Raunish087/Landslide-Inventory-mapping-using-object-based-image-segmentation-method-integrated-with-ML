# Landslide-Inventory-mapping-using-object-based-image-segmentation-method-integrated-with-ML

This project focuses on developing a robust system for landslide inventory mapping, utilizing Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) integrated with Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective is to accurately detect and map landslide-affected areas using high-resolution satellite imagery. The system leverages advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to improve the precision of landslide detection, which is crucial for disaster management and risk assessment.

Key Features
Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA):
OBIA is employed to segment the satellite images into meaningful objects rather than processing individual pixels. This approach enhances the detection accuracy by considering the shape, texture, and spatial relationship of image objects, which are important characteristics of landslide-prone areas.

Machine Learning Integration:
Various machine learning algorithms are integrated into the system to classify the segmented objects into landslide and non-landslide categories. The model is trained on labeled datasets containing landslide occurrences, allowing it to learn patterns and features associated with landslides.

High-Resolution Satellite Imagery:
The project utilizes high-resolution satellite images to capture detailed surface features. These images are pre-processed to correct for any distortions and to enhance the visibility of landslide-related features.

Automated Landslide Detection:
The system automates the process of landslide detection by applying the trained machine learning model to new satellite images. This automated approach reduces the time and effort required for manual inspection and mapping.

Geospatial Analysis:
The system integrates geospatial analysis tools to analyze the spatial distribution of detected landslides. This analysis helps in understanding the correlation between landslides and various environmental factors, such as slope, elevation, and vegetation cover.

Visualization and Reporting:
The detected landslide areas are visualized on a map, providing an intuitive understanding of the affected regions. The system also generates reports summarizing the detected landslides, including their location, size, and severity.
